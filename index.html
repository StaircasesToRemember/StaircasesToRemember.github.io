    <h1>40 Staircases you MUST visit before you die</h1>
    <p>So many things could make a staircase unforgettable; whether it’s the physical effort of climbing it, the cultural or religious meaning attached to it, or the social and political power it represents. A staircase can mark a journey upward, a moment of change, or a boundary between everyday life and something more important. It can reflect who was allowed to climb it, who was meant to be seen on it, or how generations of people have used it in rituals, protests, or celebrations. Because staircases are meant to be walked, not just admired, their meaning is felt in the body as much as understood in the mind. Visiting these staircases means stepping into history, culture, and human experience, one step at a time. </p>

    <p>The Great Wall's staircases are found on the steep hills of Northern China, mostly built during the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644 AD). They were used by soldiers to move around and carry supplies for defense against northern invaders. The steps are often steep and uneven, which made it harder for enemies to run up the wall. This challenging climb is now a famous symbol of hard work and great achievement for the Chinese people.</p>
