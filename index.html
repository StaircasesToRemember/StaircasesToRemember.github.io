    <h1>The Great Wall of China</h1>

    <p>The staircases of the Great Wall are primarily located in the mountainous northern regions of China, such as Hebei and Beijing Municipality, where they follow the steep, undulating ridges. The major construction of the continuous, brick-and-stone structure, which features these prominent staircases, dates predominantly from the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644 AD), though work on the Wall system began as early as the 7th century BC. These arduous steps were the necessary pathways for soldiers, communication, and the transportation of supplies between the strategic watchtowers and battlements. Historically, the Wall's construction was a brutal undertaking, often built by forced labor, and its primary usage was to defend the agricultural heartland against nomadic groups from the north, such as the Mongols and Manchus. Culturally, the challenging climb epitomizes the monumental human effort and perseverance required for the Wall's construction, reinforcing the famous adage that "He who has not been to the Great Wall is not a true man" (Bú dào Chángchéng fēi hǎohàn). As a relevant fact, the current generally accepted official length of the entire Great Wall system, including trenches and natural barriers, is over 21,196 kilometers (13,171 miles).</p>
