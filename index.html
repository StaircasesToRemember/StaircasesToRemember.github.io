    <p>The Great Wall of China runs across northern China, stretching thousands of miles from the eastern coast near the Bohai Sea to the deserts of the west. Construction began as early as the 7th century BCE and continued for over two thousand years, with major rebuilding during the Qin, Han, and Ming dynasties. Built to defend against invasions from the north, the wall served as a military barrier, a lookout system, and a means of controlling movement and trade. Throughout the wall, stone stairways climb steep hills and mountain ridges, often rising at sharp angles that follow the natural terrain. These stairs were designed for soldiers, not civilians: the steps are uneven, narrow, and sometimes extremely tall, allowing defenders to move quickly between watchtowers and patrol points while making it difficult for attackers to advance. Over time, these steps were worn down by marching troops, laborers, and later by travelers and tourists. Today, the stairways of the Great Wall connect past and present, carrying the physical weight of history while still guiding people across the same rugged landscape they once protected.</p>
