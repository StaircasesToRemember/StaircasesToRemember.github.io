    <title>40 Staircases you MUST visit before you die</title>
    <h1>What could be so special about staircases?</h1>
    <p>So many things could make a staircase unforgettable: it might feature a striking or beautiful design, serve as the site of a pivotal historical moment, stand as a forgotten relic of an ancient civilization, or exist as a modern spectacle shaped by contemporary design and pop culture. No matter what gives a staircase its meaning, there is only one way to fully experience what makes each of its steps so special... </p>

    <h2>The Great Wall of China</h2>

    <p>The Great Wall of China runs across northern China, stretching thousands of miles from the eastern coast near the Bohai Sea to the deserts of the west. Construction began as early as the 7th century BCE and continued for over two thousand years, with major rebuilding during the Qin, Han, and Ming dynasties. Built to defend against invasions from the north, the wall served as a military barrier, a lookout system, and a means of controlling movement and trade. Throughout the wall, stone stairways climb steep hills and mountain ridges, often rising at sharp angles that follow the natural terrain. These stairs were designed for soldiers, not civilians: the steps are uneven, narrow, and sometimes extremely tall, allowing defenders to move quickly between watchtowers and patrol points while making it difficult for attackers to advance. Over time, these steps were worn down by marching troops, laborers, and later by travelers and tourists. Today, the stairways of the Great Wall connect past and present, carrying the physical weight of history while still guiding people across the same rugged landscape they once protected.</p>
    
    <h2>Machu Picchu: The Stairs of Death</h2>

    <p>Machu Picchu is located high in the Andes Mountains of present-day Peru, perched above the Urubamba River valley. It was built in the mid-15th century during the height of the Inca Empire, likely under the rule of Emperor Pachacuti. The site served as a royal estate, religious center, and ceremonial space, carefully designed to blend with the surrounding mountains rather than dominate them. One of its most striking features is the steep stone stairway often called the Stairs of Death. These narrow, uneven steps cling tightly to the mountainside, rising sharply with little room for error. Carved directly from stone and fitted without mortar, the stairs reflect the Inca mastery of engineering and their deep understanding of the landscape. Their primary use was practical and ceremonial, allowing movement between agricultural terraces, temples, and sacred spaces while also reinforcing the spiritual significance of elevation in Inca culture. Today, the Stairs of Death test the balance and nerve of visitors, offering a physical reminder of the precision, purpose, and reverence for nature that defined Machu Picchu.</p>

    <p>The Massachusetts Institute of Technology is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, along the north bank of the Charles River. Founded in 1861, MIT developed into a leading center for science, engineering, and technological research. Building 7, completed in 1939 as part of MIT’s central campus redesign, serves as the main entrance and symbolic gateway to the Institute. The broad stone staircase in front of Building 7 rises gently from Massachusetts Avenue toward the campus interior. Unlike defensive or sacred stairways, these steps were designed to welcome and gather people. Wide, evenly spaced, and symmetrical, the staircase encourages movement, conversation, and pause rather than urgency. Over decades, it has been used by students rushing to class, visitors entering the campus for the first time, and demonstrators assembling for speeches and protests, making it a social and civic space as much as an architectural one. Today, the Building 7 staircase reflects MIT’s values of openness and exchange, standing not as a barrier to overcome but as an invitation to enter a place defined by ideas, innovation, and community.</p>
